# Text summarization with BART 

In this project we use BART which is a pretrained model created from Facebook.This model is used to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. We take some input text, tokenize it,encode the tokens ,take the digits,pass them through the model ,generate other numbers,decode them and thus generate a summary of the input text.

To create the app we use Flask which a lightweight Python framework used to created small web applications
